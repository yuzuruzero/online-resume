        <h3>Drawing</h3>
        <p>
            I really love drawing, since high school I always drawing anytime I'm free, but since I'm in college and then working, I never drawing anymore. It feels like some of my parts is missing. I'm starting to learn drawing again in this year and also I want to learn how to draw digital, I hope I can draw better than before

    <li><h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>
            I love reading since kid, when I'm still in school I always go to library to borrow books, mostly it's novel and comic sometimes. It just when I'm curious about something I always want to read it. The thickest book I ever read is the book which i borrowed from my friend, I forgot the title, but its story about an alchemist.
